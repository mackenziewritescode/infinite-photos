# Infinite Scrolling Photos with Unsplash API

This app was written as an exercise in two areas: on the back-end side to practice communicating with servers to fetch images using Node.js, Express.js and axios, and on the front-end using React hooks to create an infinite-scrolling component for the fetched images.
